Open bash and run 'ssh-keygen -t rsa-sha2-256 -P "" -f "C:\app_files\keygens\app-key" -C ""'

app-key is the key name
Files will be found in the root user directory if none is specified

use PuttyGen to load private key and save as .ppk file if needed
To use private key with SSH.Net (Renci), use PuttyGen to load private key and convert to OpenSSH formate: Conversions -> Export OpenSSH key

-t dsa | ecdsa | ecdsa-sk | ed25519 | ed25519-sk | rsa
    Specifies the type of key to create.  The possible values
    are “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ecdsa-sk”, “ed25519”, “ed25519-sk”, or
    “rsa”. This flag may also be used to specify the desired signature
    type when signing certificates using an RSA CA key.  The
    available RSA signature variants are “ssh-rsa” (SHA1
    signatures, not recommended), “rsa-sha2-256”, and
    “rsa-sha2-512” (the default).
-b "Bits" This option specifies the number of bits in the key. The regulations that govern the use case for SSH may require a specific key length to be used. In general, 2048 bits is considered to be sufficient for RSA keys.
-e "Export" This option allows reformatting of existing keys between the OpenSSH key file format and the format documented in RFC 4716, “SSH Public Key File Format”.
-p "Change the passphrase" This option allows changing the passphrase of a private key file with [-P old_passphrase] and [-N new_passphrase], [-f keyfile].
-t "Type" This option specifies the type of key to be created. Commonly used values are: - rsa for RSA keys - dsa for DSA keys - ecdsa for elliptic curve DSA keys
-i "Input" When ssh-keygen is required to access an existing key, this option designates the file.
-f "File" Specifies name of the file in which to store the created key.
-N "New" Provides a new passphrase for the key.
-P "Passphrase" Provides the (old) passphrase when reading a key.
-c "Comment" Changes the comment for a keyfile.
-p Change the passphrase of a private key file.
-q Silence ssh-keygen.
-v Verbose mode.
-l "Fingerprint" Print the fingerprint of the specified public key.
-B "Bubble babble" Shows a "bubble babble" (Tectia format) fingerprint of a keyfile.
-F Search for a specified hostname in a known_hosts file.
-R Remove all keys belonging to a hostname from a known_hosts file.
-y Read a private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.
